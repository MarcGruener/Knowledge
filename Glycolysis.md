# Glycolysis

## TL;DR:
Turning [[Glucose-6-Phosphate]] into [[Pyruvic Acid]] as a source of energy.

## Definition:
Cells need energy to function, yet many of them have very limited storage for [[ATP]] or [[Glucose]]. Therefore, the blood has to provide a constant supply of [[Glucose]] for them to function properly. From the blood, [[glucose]] can enter the cells with the help of [[insulin]] and be converted into energy. The three major reactions facilitating this are glycolysis, [[Citric Acid Cycle]], and the [[Electron Transport Chain]].

Glycolysis can have many starting points such as [[Glucose]], [[Fructose]], or [[Glycogen]] which are turned into [[Glucose-6-Phosphate]] in the first step.

At step 3, [[Glucose]] molecules with 6 carbons are split up into two separate [[Glucose]] molecules with 3 carbons each. The following steps are performed twice, once on each of the resulting molecules.

Turning [[Glucose]] into [[Fructose-1,6-Diphospate]] in Steps 1-3 requires [[ATP]] to provide the phosphate. While the overall goal of [[Glycolysis]] is to set energy free, 2 [[ATP]] per [[Glucose]] is initially needed to get the reactions started. However, during steps 6-9, 2 [[ATP]] is released for each [[Fructose-1,6-Diphospate]] (2x), resulting in a net gain of 2 [[ATP]].

During step 3, [[NAD+]] is converted to [[NADH]] which must be reoxidized ([[Redox]]) to[[ NAD+]].

Under [[aerobic]] conditions, this happens later by the [[Electron Transport Chain]]. This is a problem because glycolysis happens in the cytoplasm while the [[Electron Transport Chain]] is inside the Mitochondria which have a membrane that is not permeable to [[NADH]]. However, [[Glycerol Phosphate]] acts as a shuttle by absorbing the hydrogens and electrons and then diffuse through the membrane. Inside the mitochondria, the glycerol phosphate reacts with [[FAD]] coenzymes in [[enzyme]] complex 2 in the electron transport chain to make [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] with then diffuses back out to the [[cytoplasm]].

Under [[anaerobic]] conditions, the [[NADH]] acts as a [[Reduction|reducing]] agent to reduce [[pyruvic acid]] to [[lactic acid]] in step 10 which turns it back into [[NAD+]].

--> Glycolysis produces more energy under [[aerobic]] conditions compared to [[anaerobic]] conditions!

The overall reaction is:
$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 2\ NAD^+ + 2\ ADP + 2\ P --> 2\ pyruvic\ acid, (CH_3(C=O)COOH + 2\ ATP + 2\ NADH + 2\ H^+$
