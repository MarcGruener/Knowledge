# Polysaccharide

## TL;DR:
*Many* [[Monosaccharide|monosaccharides]] joined by [[Glycosidic Bond|glycosidic bonds]].[^1]

## Definition:
All polysaccharides are [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]], however, not all [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] are polysaccharides.[^2]

While most other [[Monosaccharide|saccharides]] are soluble in [[water]],  polysaccharides can become insoluble due to their chain length. This happens when the elements of the chain interact more strongly with themselves than with the [[water]].
