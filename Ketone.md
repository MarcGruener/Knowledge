# Ketone

## TL;DR:
Chain of carbon atoms with one forming a [[Ketone Group|ketone group]] and the others attaching [[Hydroxyl Group|hydroxyl groups]].[^5]

## Definition:
*"Ketone bodies are [[water]]-soluble molecules that contain the [[Ketone Group]] produced from [[Fatty Acid|fatty acids]] by the liver ([[Ketogenesis]]) \[and\] transported into tissues outside the liver, where they are converted into [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A|acetyl-CoA]]."*[^4]

The carbons are numbered starting with the terminal carbon closest to the keto carbon.[^5]

There are two biologically important ketone bodies:
- [[Acetoacetate]]
- [[β-Hydroxybutyrate]]
[^3]

Additionally, there is Acetone which has no biological function and is usually exhaled through the lungs. However, during diabetic [[ketoacidosis]], ketone bodies are overproduced which leads to a characteristic smell of the breath.

[[Acetoacetate]] and [[β-Hydroxybutyrate]] are important because they serve as a source of energy during long-term fasting, when there are few [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] available.[^3] 

The [[Fatty Acid|fatty acids]] required  come from the breakdown of [[Fatty Acid|fatty acids]] in the liver.[^2] Through the blood, they are transported to other tissue where they are oxidized. This makes sense, because ketones can be oxidized more easily compared to [[Fatty Acid|fatty acids]].[^3]

Ketone bodies can be transformed from and also back into [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A|acetyl-CoA]][^1], which means that "any substrate that is degraded to [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A|acetyl-CoA]] in the liver can be turned into ketone bodies \[however\], [[ketogenesis]] is associated with fatty acid oxidation, long-term fasting, and [[insulin deficiency]]."[^3] This is because *"the catabolic pathways of [[glucose]] are tightly regulated, and excess [[carbohydrate]] is turned into [[glycogen]], [[Triglycerides|fat]], and lactic acid."*[^3] As adipose tissue is broken down through lipolysis during fasting, plasma free [[Fatty Acid|fatty acids]] are elevated and the liver form large amount of [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A|acetyl-CoA]] and excess [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A|acetyl-CoA]] is diverted into [[ketogenesis]]. This is *"because β-[[Oxidation]] produces much of the [[NADH]] and [[FADH2]] that is needed for the respiratory chain, TCA cycle activity is reduced"*.[^3]

Tissues can oxidize ketones with the help of succinly-CoA to activate Acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA:
