# Ether

## TL;DR:
Organic compounds that contain an ether group ([[Functional Group]]) - an oxygen atom connected to two [[Alkyl]] or [[Aryl]] groups.[^1]

## Definition:
To complete its structure, an ether group needs 2 Carbon and 1 Oxygen atoms.[^2]

The chemical reaction leading to an Acetal is [[Condensation Reactions|condensation]] and therefore releases water and requires energy.
