# Glucagon

## TL;DR:
[[Hormones]] produced by α-Cells of the [[pancreas]] as a response to low blood [[glucose]] levels.[^1]

## Definition:
Glucagon is a [[Hormones]] produced by α-Cells located in the [[Islets of Langerhans]] of the [[Pancreas]].

It causes the release of [[glucose]] to the blood from the liver by triggering [[Glycogenesis]] and stimulating the absorption of amino acids from the blood by the liver and conversion thereof into [[Glucose]] via [[Gluconeogenesis]]. It also stimulates the release of fatty acids into the blood by adipose cells.

A negative feedback mechanism inhibits further release of glucagon when blood [[glucose]] levels rise.[^2]

Together with [[Insulin]], Glucagon are the two [[Hormones]] primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis of blood [[glucose]] levels.
