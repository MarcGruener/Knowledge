# Ion

## TL;DR:
*"Atom or molecule with a net electrical charge."*[^1]

## Definition:
When there are multiple molecules of an ionizable group present, some of them are protonated, and others deprotonated. In equilibrium, the concentration of protonated vs. deprotonated is given by the [[Dissociation Constant]].[^2]
