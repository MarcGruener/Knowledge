# ADA, 2014 - Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus


## Summary of key points:
- Diabetes is a group of [[Metabolic Disease]]s characterized by [[hyperglycemia]] resulting from defects in [[Insulin secretion]] (autoimmune destruction of pancreatic [[Î²-Cells]]), [[insulin action]] (cell resistance to [[insulin]] action/diminished tissue response to [[insulin]] action), or **both**.
- Chronic [[Hyperglycemia]] is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of different organs
- Symptoms of [[hyperglycemia]] include [[polyuria]], [[polydipsia]], [[polyphagia]], [[weight loss]], or [[blurred vision]], and in acute situations also [[ketoacidosis]] or [[nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome]]
- Long-term complications include [[retinopathy]]; [[nephropathy]]; [[peripheral neuropathy]]; [[amputations]]; [[autonomic neuropathy]]; [[gastrointestinal]], [[genitourinary]], and [[cardiovascular symptoms]]; [[sexual dysfunction]]; and [[atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease]], [[peripheral arterial disease]], [[cerebrovascular disease]]
- There are broadly two categories of Diabetes:
	- [[Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus]]: caused by an [[absolute deficiency]] of [[Insulin secretion]]
		- [[ÃŸ-cell]] Destruction Usually Leading to [[Absolute Insulin Deficiency]]
			- 5-10% of diabetics
			- Caused by [[cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction]] of the [[Î²-Cells]] of the [[pancreas]]
			- Can be identified by various markers (85-90% have them):
				- [[Islet cell autoantibodies]]
				- [[Antibodies]] to [[Insulin]]
				- [[Autoantibodies]] to [[GAD65]]
				- [[Autoantibodies]] to the [[tyrosine phosphatases]] IA-2 and IA-2ÃŸ
				- Often linked to [[HLA]] and more specifically the [[DQA]] and [[DQB]] genes and is influences by the DRB genes (can be predisposing or protective!)
			- Rate of destruction of [[Î²-Cells]] varies but is usually faster in children and slower in adults which can make detecting the disease harder as [[hyperglycemia]] develops slower due to the residual [[Î²-Cells]]
			- While there is an understanding that certain [[genetic predispositions]] and [[environmental factors]] are at play, the details are not known today
		- [[Idiopathic Diabetes]]
			- Small minority of those with T1D
			- No known [[etiologies]] but often have African or Asian ancestry and is strongly inherited
			- There is no immunological evidence of [[ÃŸ-cell]] [[autoimmunity]] and no HLA association
			- Suffer from [[episodic]] ketoacidosis and exhibit varying degrees of [[insulin]] deficiency between episodes
	- [[Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus]]: which is caused by a resistance to [[insulin action]], often combined with a deficiency of [[Insulin secretion]]
		- 90-95% of diabetics
		- The cells become [[insulin]] resistant --> they would require more [[Insulin]] to absorb the [[glucose]] from the blood plasma (relative [[insulin]] deficiency) --> [[Î²-Cells]] should react and produce more [[Insulin]] but they don't --> defective [[insulin]] secretion --> body can't compensate for [[insulin resistance]] with higher [[Insulin secretion]]
		- Severity can vary from predominantly [[insulin]] resistance with relative [[insulin]] deficiency to predominantly an [[insulin]] secretory defect with [[insulin]] resistance
		- [[Insulin]] resistance can be influenced by [[body fat]], especially in the [[abdominal region]]
		- Often undiagnosed for long time
		- Can lead to [[macrovascular complications]] and[[ microvascular complications]]
		- [[Insulin]] resistance can be improved with weight reduction and and/or [[pharmacological treatment]] but usually does not go back to normal
		- Often genetic predisposition but not quite sure which ones
	- [[Gestational Diabetes Mellitus]]
		- [[Glucose]] intolerance with the onset of the first recognition during pregnancy
		- Most cases resolve with delivery
		- Between 1-14% of all pregnancies are complicated by GCM (~7%)
	- [[Pre-Diabetes]]
		- defined as people with either
			- [[Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG)]]: 100-125 mg/dl
			- [[Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)]]: 2-h values in the oral [[glucose]] tolerance test of 140-199 mg/dl
			- IFD and IGT are not clinical entities but risk factors for diabetes
			- They are both associated with [[obesity]] and/or low [[HDL cholesterol]] and [[hypertension]] --> improving these can prevent/delay development of diabetes
			- [A1C] is also often used with a cut point for diabetes of 6-6.5% but fails to identify a substantial number of patients with IFG/IGT (they usually fall between A1C 5.5-6%)
			- IFG, IGT, and A1C cut points for diabetes are somewhat arbitrary as the risk of diabetes with any measure is a continuum, extending well into the normal ranges --> need to be balanced with [[false positives]] & [[false negatives]]
	- Other Forms
		- [[Genetic Defects]] of the ÃŸ-cells --> Genetic defects in [[Insulin]] Secretion
			- There are various forms from genetic mutations/defects affecting the [[insulin]] secretion like mutations in the [[Glucokinase]] gene on [[chromosome]] 7p which results in a defective [[glucokinase molecule]]. This defective molecule is unable to convert [[glucose]] to [[glucose-6-phosphate]] whose [[Metabolism]] stimulates [[insulin]] secretion by ÃŸ-cells
		- Genetic Defects in [[Insulin]] Action
			- Result in mutations of the [[insulin receptors]] that can range from [[hyperinsulinemia]] to modest [[hyperglycemia]] to severe diabetes
			- This has a negative impact on the [[insulin]] receptor function and extreme [[insulin]] resistance --> [[Insulin]] is in the plasma but cant be used by cells
		- Diseases of the Exocrine [[Pancreas]]
			- Any damage such as trauma and infection of the [[pancreas]] can cause diabetes by impacting the performance of the ÃŸ-cells' [[insulin]] secretion
			- Except for pancreatic cancer, this damage has to be severe
		- [[Endocrinopathies]]
			- Various [[Hormones]]s (growth hormoe, corisol, [[glucagon]], ...) can impact [[insulin]] action or [[insulin]] secretion and thereby causing diabetes
		- Drug- or Chemical-Induced Diabetes
			- Drugs can impair [[insulin]] secretion and/or [[insulin]] action and thereby increasing issues with previous [[insulin]] secretion
			- They can not cause diabetes by themselves
		- Infections
			- Certain viruses such as [[congenital rubella]] and [[coxsackievirus B]] have been implicated in inducing certain cases of diabetes
		- Uncommon Forms of Immune-Mediated Diabetes
			-[[ Stiff-man syndrome]] patients usually have high titers of the GAD autoantibodies and 1/3 develops diabetes
			- Anti-[[insulin]] receptor antibodies can cause diabetes by binding to the [[insulin]] receptors
		- Other Genetic Syndromes sometimes Associated with Diabetes
			- [[Down Syndrome]], [[Klinefelter Syndrome]], [[Turner Syndrome]], [[Wolfram Syndrome]]

- In both cases, it often starts with a [[asymptomatic]] period but can already be detected by A1C or the measurement of the plasma [[glucose]] int he fasting state
- Individuals with extensive b-cell destruction (read: T1D) and therefore no residual [[insulin]] secretion require [[insulin]] for **survival**.
- The degree of [[hyperglycemia]] reflects the severity of the underlying metabolic process and its treatment more than the nature of the process itself. --> It's not about the metabolic process itself but rather how much it happens and how it is treated aka. hoch much "food" and how much [[insulin]]
- It is often difficult to assign patients to one specific type of diabetes as there are many forces at play [[parallel]] and [[sequential]] --> It's more important to understand the [[pathogenesis]]
- Diagnostic Criteria for Diabetes Mellitus
	- Major marker here is the presence of retinopathy to identify threshold [[glucose levels]]
	- Three [[epidemiological]] studies were examined that analyzed the connection of retinopathy and [[FPG]], [[2-h PG]], and [[A1C]]
	- The studies showed that the deciles at which retinopathy began to increase were the same for each measure within the population:
		- 2-h PG: >= 200 mg/dl
		- FPG: >= 126 mg/dl
		- A1C: >= 6.5%
			- A1C was not recommended for the [[diagnoses]] but for the [[treatment]] of diabetes, but is now, due to standardized testing, also recommended for the diagnoses
			- It also makes sense to use a chronic marker such as the A1C for the diagnosis of a [[chronic]] disease compared to acute markers such as 2-h PG and FPG
			- A1C is also more convenient but is more expensive to do and is not as accurate for unique ethnic or geographic distributions
			- A1C can be inaccurate especially with fast progressing T1D in children
			- A1C >= 6.5% identifies 1/3 less compared to FPG >= 126 mg/dl
	- The results should also be validated with one of the other tests or a repetition of the same test.
