# pH Value

## TL;DR:
Proton concentration
$ph = -log[H^+]$

## Definition:
$[\Â ]\ means\ mol/L$

The ph Value of a solution depends on the presence of [[Acid|acids]] and [[Base|bases]].

The pH value is highly important in biological organisms as it determine the ratio of deprotonated to protonated [[Ion|ions]] ([[Dissociation Constant|dissociation constant]]).[^1] *"All weak acids and weak bases buffer the pH of the solution at pH values close to the [[Dissociation Constant|pK values]] of their ionizable groups."*[^1] Because $CO_2\ and\ HC^+_3$ are so abundant in the human body and can be regulated by the respiratory system, they are the most important pH buffers.

"*The ph Value of blood plasma is ~7.4 in [[Artery|arterial]] blood and 7.35 in [[Vein|venous]] blood.*"[^1] The additional carbonic [[acid]] causes the venous blood to be negatively charged which in turn means a higher pH Value.  

The more negatively charged, the higher the pH Value
