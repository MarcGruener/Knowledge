# Nitrogen Balance

## TL;DR:
*"The difference between the nitrogen entering the body and that leaving it."*[^1]

## Definition:
A healthy individual should be in nitrogen balance (nitrogen in = nitrogen out).
Growing children, pregnant women, and body builders can have a positive nitrogen balance (nitrogen in > nitrogen out).
Cancer patients and other sick people can have a negative nitrogen balance (nitrogen in > nitrogen out) because even if [[protein]]-starved, the body still degrades 30-40g of [[amino acids]] per day (dietary requirements). This can also be the case if [[essential amino acids]] are missing as the entire [[protein synthesis]] can be impaired if only one is missing.
