# Acetyl-Coenzyme A

## TL;DR:
Molecule that acts as a major source of [[metabolic energy]] in many biochemical reactions such as the [[carbohydrate metabolism]] and [[lipid metabolism]].[^1]

However, it cannot be turned back into [[pyruvic acid]] or [[Glucose]] because the dehydrogenase reaction from pyruvic acid into Acetyl-Coenzyme A is irreversible.[^3]
