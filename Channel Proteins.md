# Channel Proteins

## TL;DR:
Transmembrane proteins that function as channels for specific substances.[^1]

## Definition:
"*Channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids \[and\] hydrophilic channels through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers.*"[^1] This allows [[Chemical Polarity|polar]] compounds to pass through them without getting blocked/slowed down by the plasma membrane's [[Chemical Polarity|nonpolar]] central layer.

They can either be open at all times or gated which only open when a particular [[ion]] attaches to the channel protein.
