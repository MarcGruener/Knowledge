# Structural Enzymes

## TL;DR:
*"Structural proteins are a category of proteins responsible for functions ranging from cell shape and movement to providing support to major structures such as bones, cartilage, hair, and muscles."*[^2]


## Definition:
Structural proteins such as Collagen, Actin, Myosin, and Keratin form the basic building blocks of the cell cytoskeleton[^2] and are the most common class of [[protein]] in nature.[^3]

Structural proteins are usually long and fibrous.[^4]

Structural Proteins *"construct different structures like the cytoskeleton."*[^1]

## Examples:
- Actin
- Tubulin
- Kreatin
