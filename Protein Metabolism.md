# Protein Metabolism

## TL;DR:
The protein metabolism describes the three primary used of [[Amino Acids]] consumed through diet:
- Substrates fir the generation of metabolic energy (15-20% of energy)
- Substrates for protein [[synthesis]]
- Substrates for [[synthesis]] of other products[^1]

## Definition:
Of the 20 [[amino acids]], only 11 can be synthesized. All the others are called [[Essential Amino Acids]] and have to come from the food directly.[^1]

An adult human contains ~10kg of [[protein]] (50-75% in skeletal muscles) as well as *"small pools of free [[amino acids]] \[..\] in cells and body fluids"* and eats around 100g per day. The concentration of [[amino acids]] in the blood plasma is roughly one fourth of [[glucose]] with 20-30 mg/dl. Additionally, 250-350g of body [[protein]] is broken down each day and the same amount is used for [[Protein Synthesis]].[^1]

Because amino acids are not stored in the body, amino acids are constantly being degraded and synthesized.[^2]

*"[[Glucogenic]] amino acids are degraded to intermediates of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or [[glycolysis]] \[and\] used for [[gluconeogenesis]] during fasting.[^1]

*"[[Ketogenic]] [[amino acids]] are degraded to [[acetyl-coenzyme A]] \[and\] used for ketogenesis during fasting."*[^1]

The net rate of protein synthesis is indicated by the [[Nitrogen Balance]].[^1]

The amino group of amino acids released as ammonia which is then detoxified to urea and later synthesized in the urea cycle.[^1]
