# Amino Acids

## TL;DR:
[[Monomer|Monomers]] that are the building blocks of [[Protein|proteins]] consisting of a [[carboxyl group]] and an [[amino group]].[^2]

## Definition:
[[Monomer|Monomers]] that make up all [[Protein|proteins]] consisting of a  carbon atom in the center ($C$ or $Î±-Carbon$), bonded to a hydrogen atom ($H$), an [[amino group]] ($-NH_2$), and a [[carboxyl group]] ($-COOH$). Additionally, the central carbon atom also [[Bond|bonds]] to another variable atom or group of atoms (side chain) that determine the chemical nature of the amino acid and the [[protein]] it is part of (acidic, basic, [[Chemical Polarity|polar]], or [[Chemical Polarity|nonpolar]])[^1]

The $C$ is asymmetric which allows for two potential [[Isomer|isomers]] but only $L-amino$ occurs in [[Polypeptide|polypeptides]].[^2]

Depending on the number of amino acids involved, they can either be [[Dipeptide|dipeptides]], [[Oligopeptide|oligopeptides]], or [[Polypeptide|polypeptides]]. When these chains form, [[Peptide bond]] are formed and [[water]] is released in the process.
