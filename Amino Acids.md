# Amino Acids

## TL;DR:
Monomers that are the building blocks of proteins.

## Definition:
Monomers that make up all proteins consisting of a  carbon atom in the center ($C$), bonded to a hydrogen atom ($H$), an amino group ($-NH_2$), and a carboxyl group ($-COOH$). Additionally, the central carbon atom also bonds to another variable atom or group of atoms that determine the chemical nature of the amino acid and the protein it is part of (acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar)[^1]
