# Islets of Langerhans

## TL;DR:
Accumulations of different cells within the endocrine [[pancreas]] consisting of 4 types of cells:
- [[Glucagon]]-producing [[α-Cells]]
- [[Insulin]]-producing [[β-Cells]]
- [[Somatostatin]]-producing [[δ-Cells]]
- Pancreatic [[Polypeptide]]-producing [[PP-Cells]]

## Definition:
Throughout the endocrine [[pancreas]] of most mammals, there are distributed islands of cells, consisting of four major types (α-cells,  [[β-cells]],  δ-cells, or  PP cells).

These islets are in an oval shape with a core of [[β-cells]] and a mantle of non-β-cells for most mammals, while their shape for humans and other primates is more like a clover-leaf and more complex with a composite of several mantle-core subunits. The mantle-core structure suggests that blood flows from the [[β-cells]] in the core out through the other cells in a B-A-D-pathway.[^1]
