# Phosphate [[Ester]] [[Synthesis]]

## TL;DR:
Replacing at least one -OH [[hydroxyl]] group of [[Phosphoric Acid]] by an -O-  [[alkyl]] group to form a phosphate [[Ester]].[^1]

## Definition:


## On [[Glucose]]
Phosphate is added to the [[glucose]] at the C-6 Position through phosphate [[ester]] synthesis using the alcohol on the [[glucose]] and a phosphate from ATP by hydrolyzing ([[Hydrolysis]]) it to ADP.

## On Fructose-6-Phosphate
The alcohol group on C-1 reacts with phosphate generated by [[Hydrolysis]] from ATP to form the phosphate [[ester]] on C-1.

## On Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate
Phospate is added to the oxidized ([[Oxidation]]) Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate to form 1,3-Diphosphoglycerate.
