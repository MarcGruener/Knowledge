# β-Cells


## TL;DR:
β-Cells are located in the [[Islets of Langerhans]] of the [[pancreas]] and make and secrete [[insulin]].[^1]

## Definition:
The ß-cell synthesizes and secretes the appropriate amount of bioactive [[insulin]] mainly in response to [[glucose]] and to several nutrients, [[Hormones]] and nervous stimuli" and thereby "plays a primary role in the maintenance of [[glucose]] homeostasis". The goal is to "maintain plasma [[glucose]] levels in a tight physiological range for optimal functioning of all tissues in the body".[^2]

While it is known that "[[glucose]] is the prime modulator of [[insulin]] secretion, [...], the precise mechanism and factors that are involved in the [[insulin]] secretory process are not sully understood."[^2]

However, studies suggest that the "IGF-1 and/or the [[insulin]] receptor regulate [[glucose]] sensing and indicate a potential feedback effect of [[insulin]] on its own secretion and/or β-cell growth."

Additionally, the role of [[Glucokinase]] in the secretion process has been researched
