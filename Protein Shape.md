# Protein Shape

## TL;DR:
The shape of a protein is critical to its function and characterized on 4 levels.[^1]

## Definition:
The four levels characterizing the shape of a protein are:
- [[Primary Protein Structure]]
- [[Secondary Protein Structure]]
- [[Tertiary Protein Structure]]
- [[Quaternary Protein Structure]]
[^1]
The structure of a protein can be influenced by changes in external factors such as exposure to chemicals, pH, or temperature. These changes are called [[Denaturation]]. Depending on the specific case, these changes can be reversible or irreversible and result in a permanent loss of function.[^2]
