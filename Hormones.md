# Hormones

## TL;DR:
Chemical-signalig molecules that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes[^1] of cells with a receptor for it.[^2]

## Definition:
Hormones are usually small proteins or steroids, secreted into the blood stream via interstitial fluid by the cells of the [[Endocrine System]] which are often located in specific organs. They control or regulate specific physiological processes like growth, development, [[metabolism]], and reproduction through their chemical-signaling properties.[^1] [^2]

Hormones bind to specific cell-surface intercellular hormone receptors. This way, they only have an impact on the cells that have these receptors whereby the cell's sensitivity to a hormone is determined by the number of receptors.[^2]

## Examples:
- [[Insulin]]
- Thyroxine
