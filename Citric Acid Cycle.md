# Citric Acid Cycle

## TL;DR:
Process that produces most of the [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] in the body through a series of dehydrogenations and decarboxylations of [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A]].

## Definition:
The citric acid cycle is the final pathway for the [[oxidation]] reactions that produces [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] through a series of dehydrogenations and decarboxylations in the body and is the final step of the [[metabolism]] (all 3 forms).[^1]

The reactions take place in the [[mitochondria]] of the cells.[^3]
$acetyl\ CoA + 3 H_2O + 3 NAD^+ + FAD + ADP\ -> HSCoA + 2 CO_2 + NADH + 3H^+ + FADH_2 + ATP$
