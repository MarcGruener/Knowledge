# Glycosidic Bond

## TL;DR:
[[Acetal]] [[Bond|bonds]] involving the [[Anomer|anomeric]] carbon of one of the participating [[Monosaccharide|monosaccharides]]. [^1]

## Definition:
The bonds can either have an α- or β-configuration but these bonds cannot perform [[Mutarotation|mutarotations]].[^1]

[[Carbohydrate|Carbohydrates]] can form glycosidic bonds with proteins and lipids, resulting in [[Glycoprotein|glycoproteins]] and [[Glycolipid]] respectively. Depending on whether the sugar to an oxygen or nitrogen atom, they are called *O-glycosidic* or *N-glycosidic* respectively.[^1]
