# Digestive Enzymes

## TL;DR:
Proteins that help digesting *"food by catabolizing nutrients into monomeric units."*[^1]

## Definition:
Most nutrients consumed are large polymers that have to be broken down through hydrolytic cleavage reactions into monosaccharides, [[amino acids]], and fatty acids before they can be absorbed by the [[digestive system]]. Due to their specialization of function, multiple enzymes are needed to corporate in order to achieve this goal.[^2]

Digestion happens in various steps and with the help of different enzymes throughout the entire [[Digestive System]].[^3]

Digestive enzymes are produced by different organs including the [[pancreas]][^4], salivary glands within the cavity[^5], ...

There are certain special digestive enzymes such [[brush border]] enzymes that are attached to the lumenal surface of mucosal cells in the microvilli.

There are also enzymes that would in fact destroy the cells producing it. Therefore, these enzymes are released inactive as [[zymogens]] until they reach the lumen of the Gi tract where they are activated by [[selective proteolytic cleavage]].[^7]

## Examples:
- Amylase
- Lipase
- Pepsin
- Trypsin
