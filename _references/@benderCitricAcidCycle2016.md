## Abstract
OBJECTIVESAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to:Describe the reactions of the citric acid cycle and the reactions that lead to the production of reducing equivalents that are oxidized in the mitochondrial electron transport chain to yield ATP. Explain the importance of vitamins in the citric acid cycle.Explain how the citric acid cycle provides both a route for catabolism of amino acids and also a route for their synthesis.Describe the main anaplerotic pathways that permit replenishment of citric acid cycle intermediates, and how the withdrawal of oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis is controlled.Describe the role of the citric acid cycle in fatty acid synthesis.Explain how the activity of the citric acid cycle is controlled by the availability of oxidized cofactors.Explain how hyperammonemia can lead to loss of consciousness.
