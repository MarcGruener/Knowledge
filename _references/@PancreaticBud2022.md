## Abstract
The ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds (or pancreatic diverticula) are outgrowths of the duodenum during human embryogenesis. They join to form the adult [[pancreas]].
The proximal portion of the dorsal pancreatic bud gives rise to the accessory pancreatic duct, while the distal portion of the dorsal pancreatic bud and ventral pancreatic bud give rise to the major pancreatic duct.
The ventral pancreatic bud develops into the pancreatic head and uncinate process.
