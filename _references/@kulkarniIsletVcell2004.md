## Abstract
The ␤-cell is one of four major types of cells present in the islets of Langerhans, which are islands of cells distributed throughout the endocrine [[pancreas]] in most mammals. The ␤-cell synthesizes and secretes the hormone [[insulin]] mainly in response to glucose but also in response to several nutrients, [[Hormones]] and nervous stimuli. In adult rodents the ␤-cell has a slow mitotic rate. Recent studies provide novel insights into the functions of the ␤-cell. The presence of functional [[insulin]]-like growth factor-1 and [[insulin]] receptors and components of their signaling pathway indicate an important role for [[insulin]]/IGF-1 signaling in the regulation of ␤-cell function. Further, the recent discovery of [[glucokinase]] (GK) and the ATP-dependent potassium channels on [[insulin]] secretory granules, the detection of AMP-protein kinase in the ␤-cell and the identiﬁcation of a new ␤-cell transcription factor, mMafA, are some exciting new areas of research currently underway to further understand the complex pathways that regulate the functions of ␤-cells.
