## Abstract
Lactose, a disaccharide, is a sugar composed of galactose and glucose subunits and has the molecular formula C12H22O11.  Lactose makes up around 2â€“8% of milk (by weight). The name comes from lac (gen. lactis), the Latin word for milk, plus the suffix -ose used to name sugars.  The compound is a white, water-soluble, non-hygroscopic solid with a mildly sweet taste.  It is used in the food industry.
