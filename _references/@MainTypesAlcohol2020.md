## Abstract
Chemistry, as a field, acknowledges three main types of alcohol: isopropyl, methyl, and ethyl alcohol. Each of these types of alcohol has different properties. Alcohols are those organic compounds. The presence of one, two or more hydroxyl groups (âˆ’OH) are the main characteristic of these compound.
