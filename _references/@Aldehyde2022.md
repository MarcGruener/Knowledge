## Abstract
In organic chemistry, an aldehyde () is an organic compound containing a functional group with the structure Râˆ’CH=O. The functional group itself (without the "R" side chain) can be referred to as an aldehyde but can also be classified as a formyl group.  Aldehydes are common and play important roles in the technology and biological spheres.
