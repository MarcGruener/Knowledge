# Monosaccharide

## TL;DR:
[[Monomer|Monomers]] consisting of a chain or carbon atoms with one forming a [[carbonyl group]] and the others attaching [[Hydroxyl Group|hydroxyl groups]].[^1]

## Definition:
Monosaccharides are [[Simple Carbohydrate|simple carbohydrates]].

Depending on the $R'$ of the [[carbonyl group]], monosaccharides can either be [[Ketone]] or [[Aldose]].

Monosaccharides are also categorized according to the length of the carbon chain:
- [[Triose]]
- [[Tetrose]]
- [[Pentose]]
- [[Hexose]]
- [[Heptose]]

Monosaccharides have many [[Epimer|epimers]] due to their asymmetric carbons.

Monosaccharides also form ring structures when their [[Aldehyde Group|aldehyde group]]|[[Ketone Group|ketone group]] form [[Hamiacetal Bond]]|[[Hemiketal Bond]] with another [[hydroxyl group]]. The number of carbon atoms forming the ring also determines its name:
- [[Furanose Ring]]
- [[Pyranose Ring]]

Because the rings of the monosaccharide becomes asymmetric (C1 of the [[aldehyde group]] for [[Aldose|aldoses]] and C2 for the [[Ketone Group|ketone group]] for [[Ketone|ketones]]), two [[Isomer|isomers]] called [[Anomer|anomers]] form: α-[[Anomer|anomers]] & β-[[Anomer|anomers]]. An equilibrium between both [[Anomer|anomers]] is reached within hours but the [[Acid|acids]] and [[Base|bases]] can speed up this process.[^1]

[[D-]][[Glucose]] is the most important monosaccharide.
