# Secondary Protein Structure

## TL;DR:
*"Hydrogen bonding of the peptide backbone causes the amino acids to fold into a repeating pattern"*[^1]

## Definition:
The secondary structure of proteins is defined by the folding patterns caused by interactions of the non-R groupd portions of amino acids (hydrogen, amino group, and carboxyl group).

There are two general secondary protein structures: Beta-pleated sheet & Alpha Helix:[^2]
