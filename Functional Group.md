# Functional Group

## TL;DR:
Functional groups determine the chemical reactivities and physical properties of molecules.[^1]

## Definition:
There are four functional groups in biomolecules:
- [[Hydrocarbon Groups]]
- [[Oxygen-Containing Groups]]
- [[Nitrogen-Containing Groups]]
- [[Sulfur-Containing Groups]]

These functional groups can often form bonds through [[Condensation Reactions]]. The [[Cleavage]] of these bonds requires water and is called [[Hydrolysis]].
