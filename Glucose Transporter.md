# [[Glucose]] Transporter

## TL;DR:
Facilitate the diffusion of [[glucose]] across the cell plasma membrane.

## Definition:
While soluble in water, [[glucose]] cannot enter cells by passive diffusion but requires the cells to use carriers of the GLUT (**glu**cose **t**ransporter) family. The diffusion does not require energy because [[glucose]] is always present at high concentrations in the blood of around 100mg/dl.

There are four different GLUTs:

GLUT4 requires [[insulin]] to transfer [[glucose]] from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane. This means that muscle and adipose tissues only take up [[glucose]] after carbon-rich meals when [[insulin]] levels are high and not during fasting when [[insulin]] is low. Muscle and adipose tissue can subsist on fatty acids and other nutrients when [[glucose]] is low while [[glucose]] is redirected to other tissue such as the brain because they depend on [[glucose]] as their source of energy.
