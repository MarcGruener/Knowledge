# Maltose

## TL;DR:
[[Disaccharide]]/[[simple carbohydrate]] consisting of two [[glucose]] $C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$.[^1] [^2]

## Definition:
*"Doesn't occur naturally in any appreciable amount in foods, with one exception: sprouted grains"* because they break down starch into maltose.[^1]

Only difference to [[Sucrose|sucrose]] and [[Lactose|lactose]] is the arrangement of the atoms.
