# Carrier Proteins

## TL;DR:
Transmembrane proteins that bind to substances and moving them into a cell by changing their shape.[^1]

## Definition:
Carrier proteins are specific to one substance and therefore are part of a cell's membrane selectivity. 

They bind to substances which triggers a change of their shape. It is not fully understood, how exactly the shape change happens.[^1]

Because they have to change their shape, the rate at which carrier proteins can transport material into a cell is slower compared to [[Channel Proteins]],[^2]
