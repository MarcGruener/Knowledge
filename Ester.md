# Ester

## TL;DR:
Organic compound derived from an [[Acid]] in which at least one $-OH$ [[Hydroxyl Group]] group is replaced by an $-O-$ [[Alkyl]] group.[^1] [^2]

## Definition:
To complete its structure, an ester group needs 2 Carbon and 2 Oxygen atoms.[^3]

$R$ and $R'$ are both [[Alkyl|alkyl groups]].[^3]
