# Tertiary Protein Structure

## TL;DR:
*"Three-dimensional folding pattern of a protein due to side chain interactions."*[^1]

## Definition:
The tertiary structure of a protein defines the three-dimensional structure caused by interactions between the R groups of various amino acids and regions throughout the chains. The bonds formed between these can either be ionic bonds or hydrogen bonding. The arrangement of amino acids is dependent on their polarity. "Hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids lay in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups lay on the outside."
