# Glycogenolysis

## TL;DR:
Turning [[glycogen]] into [[glucose-1-phosphate]] and later [[glucose-6-phosphate]].

## Definition:
[[Lysis]]
The process of turning [[glycogen]] stored in the liver into [[glucose]] is triggered by [[glucagon]] released by the [[pancreas]] and epinephrine from the adrenal glands in response to low [[glucose]] levels. Both [[Hormones]] act upon enzymes to stimulate [[glycogen]] phosphorylase to begin glycogenolysis and inhibit [[glycogen]] synthetase (stop [[glycogenesis]]).[^1]

The liver of an adult can store between 100g and 120g of [[glycogen]] (8% of the fresh weight) and [[glycogen]] concentration in the skeletal muscles is usually 1% or less (due to the overall mass of skeletal muscles, the total amount of [[Glycogen]] is stored here is higher than in the liver).[^2]

This reaction neither uses nor releases energy.
