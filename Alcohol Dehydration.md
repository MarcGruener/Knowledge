# Alcohol Dehydration

## TL;DR:
Reaction of alcohol with an [[acid]] during which the alcohol looses water molecules and forms [[Alkenes]].[^1]

## Definition:
![[Pasted image 20220606135751.png]]

Depending on the type of alcohol, the temperature required for this reaction differs:
- Primary (Methyl) Alcohol: $170°-180°C$
- Secondary (Isopropyl) Alcohol: $100°-140°C$
- Tertiary (Ethyl) Alcohol: $25°-80°C$[^2] [^3]

This means that for biochemical reactions, only tertiary alcohols are feasible.

## Example
![[Pasted image 20220606141313.png]][^4]

## On 2-Phosphoglyceric Acid
The $-OH$ on $C-3$ and the $-H$ on $C-2$ are removed to make water and a double bond between $C-2$ and $C-3$ is formed.
