# Metabolism

## TL;DR:
Metabolism is the process of digesting food and breaking down its [[macronutrients]] ([[amino acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, or [[lipid]]s) into [[glucose]] and acids which can either be stored by the body in the liver, muscles, or body fat, or be turned into energy.[^3]

## Definition:
The goal of metabolism is the generation of metabolic energy by degrading all nutrients (carbohydrates, fat, protein, and alcohol) to [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A]]. 

There are three different kinds of metabolism:
- [[Protein Metabolism]]
- [[Carbohydrate Metabolism]]
- [[Lipid Metabolism]]

While they are based on different macronutrients, the goal/result of all three is the same: The creation of [[ATP]] through the [[Citric Acid Cycle]].[^1]

A complete dies must supply the elements:
- [[Carbon]]
- [[Hydrogen]]
- [[Oxygen]]
- [[Nitrogen]]
- [[Phosphorous]]
- [[Sulfur]]
- + >18 inorganic elements
The major elements are supplied in [[carbohydrates]], [[lipids]], and [[Protein]] plus at least 17 vitamins and water, otherwise certain deficiency symptoms appear.[^2]
