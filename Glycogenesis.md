# Glycogenesis

## TL;DR:
Turns [[Glucose]] into [[Glycogen]].

## Definition:
[[Genesis]]

[[Glucose]] which is not immediately needed can be stored in the liver (and the muscles) in the form of [[glycogen]].[^1]

The process of turning [[glucose]] into [[Glycogen]] by adding [[glucose]] molecules to chains of [[glycogen]] is called Glycogenesis.[^2]

This process has multiple steps:
1. Turning [[glucose]] into [[Glucose-6-Phosphate]] through [[Hexokinase]]
2. Turning [[Glucose-6-Phosphate]] into [[Glucose-1-Phosphate]] through Phosphoglucomutase
3. Turning [[Glucose-1-Phosphate]] into [[UDP-Glucose]] through [[UDP-Glucose-Pyrophosphorylase]]
4. Adding [[UDP-Glucose]] to existing [[Glycogen]] through [[Glycogen]] Synthase
