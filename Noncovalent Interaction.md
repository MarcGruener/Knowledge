# Noncovalent Interaction

## TL;DR:
Weak and reversible bindings between molecules.[^1]

## Definition:
Weak interactions between complementary molecules that break and re-form all the time.
There are 5 different types of noncovalent interactions:
- [[Dipole-dipole Interaction]]
- [[Electrostatic Interaction]]
- [[Ion-Dipole Interaction]]
- [[Hydrophobic Interaction]]
- [[van der Waals Force]]

They also determine the biological properties of [[biomolecules]]:
- [[Water]] solubility: [[Hydrogen Bond|Hydrogen Bonds]] & [[Ion-Dipole Interaction|Ion-Dipole Interactions]]
- Higher-order structures of [[macromolecules]]: combination of many because by themselves, they are rather weak
- Binding interactions between molecules: hugely important mechanism[^1]
