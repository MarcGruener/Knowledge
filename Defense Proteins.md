# Defense Proteins

## TL;DR:
Defense proteins are also often called antibodies, which are *"specialized proteins \[..\] for defense against viruses and bacteria."*[^1]

## Definition:
*"An antibody molecule is comprised of four polypeptides: twi identical heavy chains (large peptide units) that are partially bound to each other in a "Y" formation, which are flanked by two identical light chains (small peptide units)."*[^1]

Dependent on their physiochemical, structural, and immunological properties, defense proteins are further divided up into five classes:

*"This 3-dimensional structure allows \[antibodies\] to identify and bind to very specific foreign molecules \[...\] and help neutralize them and tag them, facilitating their engulfment and removal by defensive cells."*[^3]

## Examples:
- Immunoglobulin
