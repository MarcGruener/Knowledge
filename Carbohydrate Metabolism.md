# Carbohydrate [[Metabolism]]

## TL;DR:
Turning the [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] consumed with food into energy.

## Definition:
After food is consumed, [[Monosaccharide|monosaccharides]] are absorbed in the small intestine into the blood stream. The concentration of [[glucose]] in the blood is regulated by [[insulin]], [[glucagon]], and epinephrine. Is the concentration too high, the [[pancreas]] secrets [[insulin]] "which stimulates the transfer of [[glucose]] into the cells, especially in the liver and muscles".[^1]

The carbohydrate [[metabolism]] has multiple sub-components including:
- [[Glycogenesis]]
- [[Glycogenolysis]]
- [[Gluconeogenesis]]
- [[Glycolysis]]

The fundamental biochemical reaction is the following:
 $C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 -> 6 CO_2 + 6 H_2O + energy$
