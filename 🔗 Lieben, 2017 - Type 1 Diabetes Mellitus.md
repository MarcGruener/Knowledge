# Lieben, 2017 - Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

## Summary of key points:
- [[Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus]] is a [[Chronic Disease]] characterized by [[Hyperglycemia]] owing to [[insulin deficiency]] as a consequence of pancreatic [[ÃŸ-cell]] loss
- Peak [[incidence]] is between ages of 12 and 14
- T1DM is a [[polygenic disease]] and the major genetic risk factors are [[HLA-DR3-DQ2]] and [[HLA-DR4-DQ8]] [[haplotypes]], but several non-HLA [[risk factors]] have been identified
- By conducting [[Genetic Tests]] or [[Autoantibody Tests]], [[Immunosuppressive]] Therapy could be used to slow down [[immune-mediated]] [[ÃŸ-cell]] loss as [[Secondary Prevention]] or [[Treatment]], unfortunately, this has not been proven to be successful alone

## Disease Progression
1. [[Immune cells]] target [[ÃŸ-cell]] [[antigens]]
2. [[ÃŸ-cell]]s can no longer produce [[insulin]]
3. [[Insulin deficiency]]
4. [[Hyperglycemia]]
5. First symptoms appear
	1. [[Hyperglycemia]]
	2. [[Polyuria]]
	3. [[Polydipsia]]
	4. [[Weight Loss]]
	5. [[Abdominal Symptoms]]
	6. [[Headaches]]
	7. [[Ketoacidosis]]
6. [[Microvascular]] and [[macrovascular]] complications
