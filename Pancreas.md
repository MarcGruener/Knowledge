# Pancreas

## TL;DR:


## Definition:
The pancreas is located between the stomach and the small intestine. During the embryogenesis, the [[glucagon]]-rich dorsal bud turns into the splenic (body & tail) and the ventral bud turns into the pancreatic-polypeptide-rich duodenal (head) portion of the [[pancreas]]. [^1] [^3] [^4]

[^2]

The pancreas contains both [[Exocrine System|exocrine]] cells that excrete digestive [[enzymes]] and [[Endocrine System|endocrine]] cells that release [[Hormones]] ([[Insulin]] and [[Glucagon]]). The endocrine cells form the [[Islets of Langerhans]].[^5]
