# Gluconeogenesis

## TL;DR:
Turning non-[[carbohydrate]] sources into [[Glucose]].

## Definition:
[[Genesis]]

This process usually turns Pyruciv Acid into [[Glucose]], while oxaloacetic acid and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, as well as lactic acid, some amino acids, and glycerol can also be used.

The steps of Gluconeogenesis are similar to the ones of [[Glycolysis]] in reversed order, however not exactly, there are 3 additional ones.

In the first step, pyruvic acid is turned into oxaloacetic acid which usually reacts with [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A]] in the [[Citric Acid Cycle]]. Depending on the concentration of both [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A]] and [[ATP]], [[oxaloacetic acid]] reacts with one or the other:
- low [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A]] and high [[ATP]] --> Gluconeogenesis
- high [[Acetyl-Coenzyme A]] and low [[ATP]] --> [[Citric Acid Cycle]]

Gluconeogenesis mainly happens in the liver, and to a very small extend in the brain, skeletal muscles, heart muscles or other parts of the body. 

Gluconeogenesis and the liver are therefore an important part in maintaining blood [[glucose]] levels.

This reaction requires energy.[^1]
