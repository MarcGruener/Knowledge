# Water

## TL;DR:
Molecule consisting of one Oxygen and two Hydrogen atoms.

## Definition:

The oxygen atom has a high electron density and therefore also a partial negative charge $δ^-$ ([[anion]]), whereas the hydrogen atoms are electron deficient and have a partial positive charge $δ^+$ ([[Cation|cation]]). The molecule is an electrical dipole:

This also means that the hydrogen atoms of a water molecule are attracted to the oxygen atom of another water molecule and forms weak [[Hydrogen Bond|hydrogen bond]] ($29kJ/[[Mole|mol]]$) compared to the [[Covalent Bond|covalent]] oxygen-hydrogen [[Bond|bonds]] within the molecule ($450kcal/[[Mole|mol]]$).

The [[Chemical Polarity|dipolar]] nature of water also explains why salts are soluble in water to form a solution through [[Ion-Dipole Interaction|ion-dipole interactions]].[^1]
