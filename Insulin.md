# Insulin

## TL;DR:
[[Hormones]] produced by [[β-cells]] of the [[Pancreas]] as a response to high blood [[glucose]] levels.[^1]

## Definition:
Insulin is a [[Hormones]] produced by [[β-Cells]] located in the [[Islets of Langerhans]] of the [[Pancreas]].

It enhances the rate of [[glucose]] uptake and utilization by target cells which use it for the production of [[ATP]]. It increases [[glucose]] transport into skeletal muscle and liver cells by binding to insulin receptors that triggers the cell to incorporate [[Glucose Transporter|glucose transport proteins]] into its membrane. However, not all cells require insulin for the diffusion of [[Glucose]] (brain and kidneys don't).

It also stimulates the liver to convert [[glucose]] to [[glycogen]] and adipocytes to convert [[Glucose]] into fat.

Together with [[Glucagon]], Insulin are the two [[Hormones]] primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis of blood [[glucose]] levels.[^2]

A negative feedback mechanism inhibits further release of insulin when blood [[glucose]] levels fall.
