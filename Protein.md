# Protein

## TL;DR:
*"One of the three major nutrients (along with [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] and [[Triglycerides|fats]]). It is used by the body for building and repairing tissues."*[^1]

Proteins are [[Amino Acids|Amino Acid]] Polymers arranged in a linear sequence and have a diverse range of functions and uses.[^4]

## Definition:
*"Protein is derived primarily from animal sources but can be obtained from nuts and seed, some grains, and other plant sources."*[^1] Proteins are digested in the Stomach by the [[enzyme]] pepsin.[^5] After [[water]] (60%), protein makes up the most of an average adult.[^2] 

The basis of proteins are [[Amino Acids]] linked together by ([[Covalent Bond|covalent]]) peptide bonds.[^3] These [[Bond|bonds]] are created by a [[dehydration]] reaction of the [[carboxyl group]] of one [[Amino Acids|amino acid]] with the [[amino group]] of another.[^6] They serve various purposed such as transport, storage, or membranes as well as toxins and [[enzyme|enzymes]].[^6] Depending on their types, they can have one of multiple functions:
- [[Digestive Enzymes]]
- [[Transport Proteins]]
- [[Structural Enzymes]]
- [[Hormones]]
- [[Defense Proteins]]
- [[Contractile Proteins]]
- [[Storage Proteins]]
[^4]

Proteins are therefore polypeptides of [[amino acids]] with a distinct shape and a unique function. The [[Protein Shape]] is critical to its function and characterized on 4 levels.[^7]

All proteins consist of various arrangements of the same 20 types of [[amino acids]] (more might be discovered in the future).[^4]
