# Isomerization

## TL;DR:
Process of turning a molecule, ion, or molecular fragment into an [[Isomer]] of a different chemical structure.[^2]

## Definition:

## Of Dihydroxyacetonephosphate
This reaction happens in two steps, first the Dihydroxyacetonephosphate is converted into Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate through isomerization between the keone group and an aldehyde group.

## Of 3-Phosphoglyceric Acid
3-Phospohoglyceric Acid is turned into 2-Phosphoglyceric Acid through Isomerization through a reaction catalyzed by Phosphoglycerate Mutase.
