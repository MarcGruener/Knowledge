## On ATP
Turning ATP and water into ADP, Phosphate, and energy:
$ATP\ +\ H_2O --> ADP\ +\ P\ + energy$[^1]

## On 1,3-Diphosphoglycerate
One of the Phosphate groups undergoes hydrolysis to form the [[acid]], energy, and a phosphate ion which is directly transferred to and ADP to make ATP using the released energy.
