# Hydrolysis

## TL;DR:
Any chemical reaction in which a molecule of water breaks one or more chemical bonds.

## Definition:
Hydrolysis is an [[Exergonic]] reaction and is catalyzed by acids, bases, or [[Enzyme|enzymes]]. A bond dissolved by Hydrolysis is called 'hydrolytic'.[^2] 

## On [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]]
Turning [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] and water into [[Adenosine Diphosphate|ADP]], Phosphate, and energy:
$ATP\ +\ H_2O --> ADP\ +\ P\ + energy$[^1]

## On 1,3-Diphosphoglycerate
One of the Phosphate groups undergoes hydrolysis to form the [[acid]], energy, and a phosphate [[ion]] which is directly transferred to and [[Adenosine Diphosphate|ADP]] to make [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] using the released energy.
