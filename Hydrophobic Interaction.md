# Hydrophobic Interaction

## TL;DR:
Low attractive force between [[Chemical Polarity|nonpolar]] molecules or [[Chemical Polarity|nonpolar]] portions of molecules.[^1]

## Definition:
[[Chemical Polarity|Non polar]] groups can minimize the area of contact with [[water]] molecules by clustering together. By reorientating, [[water]] molecules maximize [[Hydrogen Bond|hydrogen bonds]]. This structure results in a thermodynamically unfavorable state.
