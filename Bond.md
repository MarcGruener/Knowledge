# Bond

## TL;DR:


## Definition:
There are different types of bonds that can connect molecules:
- [[Ether]]
- [[Carboxylic Ester]]
- [[Acetal]]
- [[Mixed Anhydride]]
- [[Phosphoanhydride]]
- [[Phosphate Ester]]
- [[Phosphodiester]]
- [[Unsubstituted Amine]]
- [[Substituted Amine]] 
- [[Thioester]]
- [[Thioether]]


Different bonds contain different amounts of energy that are required to form the bonds, and released when during bond [[cleavage]]:
- $4-20kJ/[[Mole|mol]]$: Most [[Ester|ester]], ether, acetal, and amine bonds
- $>20kJ/[[Mole|mol]]$: anhydride and thioester
