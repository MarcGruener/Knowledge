# Oxidation

## TL;DR:
Reactions in which the [[Oxidation State|oxidation number]] of an atom becomes larger (loss of electrons).[^2]

## Definition:
Originally, reactions in which an element combines with an oxygen atom were called Oxidation.

However, after the discovery of electrons, it was discovered that during chemical reactions, the [[Oxidation State]] of atoms changes. Therefore, Oxidation occurs when the [[Oxidation State|oxidation number]] of an atom becomes larger (loss of electrons).[^1]

This is linked to [[Reduction]] and [[Redox]]

## Of Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate
The aldehyde part of Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate oxidizes to an [[acid]] through the conversion of $NAD^+$ to $NADH\ + H^+$.
